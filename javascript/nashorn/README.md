Java 8 furnishes Nashorn, a JavaScript engine which runs on the JVM including JDK, JRE, and the embeded JVM in the Oracle database a..k.a. OJVM.
This folder stores database related Nashorn based examples (i.e., plain JavaScript + SQL statements) including JavaScript with OJVM, and JavaScript with JDK/JRE. 

Nashorn allows interoperability between Java and JavaScript, therefore, the SQL statements are invoked using JDBC which is a portable standard Java API.
