After installing cx_Oracle, the demos can be run by executing each script file
with Python. The scripts all assume that the cx_Oracle
[test suite](https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle/tree/master/test)
objects have been installed in your database and that the connect string
"cx_Oracle/dev@localhost/orcl" is valid. If this is not correct, adjust the
connect string before running the test.
