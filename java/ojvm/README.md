# OJVM based examples
This folder stores Java based examples for the embedded JVM of the Oracle Database (a.k.a. OJVM).

Running Java in Oracle database OJVM allows reusing Java code, Java libraries, Java skills (developers) for data-bound applications.
Running Java code directly in the database cuts networm trafic thereby resulting in better performance. Some of the examples show running the same code inside and outside the database (as plain Java client code).
