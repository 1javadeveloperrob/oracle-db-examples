- Performance: JIT (OJVM), Network Compression over WAN (JDBC), Configurable connection health check frequency (UCP), PL/SQL Callback
  interface (JDBC)
- Scalability: Shared Pool for Multi-Tenant Database (UCP), Shared Pool for Sharded database (UCP), Sharding Key APIs (JDBC, UCP),
  DRCP Proxy session sharing, DRCP support for  multiple labels
