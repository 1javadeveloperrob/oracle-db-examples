# Universal Connection Pool (UCP)
The Oracle Universal Connection Pool (UCP) is a feature rich Java connection pool tightly integrated with all Oracle database configurations and architectures, providing high availability, scalability and load balancing for Java applications. 
To use UCP, Java applications or containers must have **ucp.jar** in their class path along with **ojdbc8.jar** (for JDK or JRE 8).

## What's new in 12.2 ? 

* **New Java Standards**: Support for Java SE 8 and JDBC 4.2  
* **New Performance features**: UCP redesign for faster pool operations using Wait-Free technique, Multi-dimensionnal KD-Tree 
  search, and configurable connection health check frequency
* **New Scalability features**: Shared Pool for Multitenant Database, Shared Pool for Sharded database, Sharding APIs
* **New High Availability features**: Fast Application Notification (FAN) and Oracle Notification Services (ONS) are auto-enabled,
  Application Continuity for XA Datasources, and Transaction Guard for XA Datasource
* **New Manageability features**: XML configuration file
